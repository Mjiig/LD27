		<h1>Out of Time!</h1>
		<p>You have 10 seconds on the clock, complete the games to earn more time. Each of the possible games has it's own rules, which you'll have to figure out on your own. Clicking on green things is often a good way to go. Every game you win will earn you another 2 seconds.</p>
		<p> If it seems too easy to start with bear in mind that the game gets (much) harder as it goes along. The current highscore I've been told of for this build is 41</p>
